## Authorization

Auth is handled by a file that you'll need to create.

That file is named reddit.json - this is going to be the in the format of:

```javascript
{
    'REDDIT_TOKEN':<token_here>,
    'REDDIT_SECRET':<secret_here>,
    'REDDIT_REFRESH_TOKEN':<refresh_token_here>,
    'REDDIT_CONSUMER_KEY':<consumer_key_here>,
    'REDDIT_CONSUMER_SECRET':<consumer_secret_here>
}
```
