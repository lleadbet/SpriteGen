## Authorization

Auth is handled by two files that you'll need to create (but have samples included in the repo).

The first is a file named reddit.json - this is going to be the in the format of:

```javascript
{
    "REDDIT_TOKEN":"",
    "REDDIT_SECRET":"",
    "REDDIT_REFRESH_TOKEN":"",
    "REDDIT_CONSUMER_KEY":"",
    "REDDIT_CONSUMER_SECRET":""
}
```

The second is a file named config.json - this is the application configuration file.

```javascript
{
    "REDDIT_TOKEN":"",
    "REDDIT_SECRET":"",
    "REDDIT_REFRESH_TOKEN":"",
    "REDDIT_CONSUMER_KEY":"",
    "REDDIT_CONSUMER_SECRET":""
}
```
